        <h2>I am a software engineer based out of Buda, Tx. I have been interested in engineering since I was in highschool. I took engineering all throughout highschool. I became familiar with software engineering this past year and immediatly was drawn to it due to the creative process and the ability to create from scratch. I enjoy problem solving and being able to collaborate with a team to find repeatable solutions. I have past experience as a Line mechanic working on heavy equipment. So using my resources to troubleshoot new issues is a daily occurence. </h2>
